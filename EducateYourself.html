      <h3 class="pfont">WHY Exercise is so Underrated</h3>
      <p class="pfont">Exercise is good for the heart and makes you look good. However, there are much more compelling reasons to exercise regularly. The human brain is an exceedingly complex organ, and while we don't fully understand it, it is what we have to use to understand and interact with the world around us. Research is showing that there is a very powerful connection between the nervous system and movement. Exercise has been shown to facilitate the growth of new neurons, paving the way for greater intelligence. </p>
