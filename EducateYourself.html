        <p class="pfont">Exercise is good for the heart and makes you look good. However, there are much more compelling reasons to exercise regularly.

Research is showing that there is a very powerful connection between the nervous system and movement. Exercise has been shown to facilitate the growth of new neurons, paving the way for greater intelligence.
